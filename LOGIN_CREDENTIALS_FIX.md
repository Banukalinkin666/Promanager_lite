# Login Credentials Fix

## 🔴 **Issue Identified:**

Login was failing with "Invalid credentials" error because the **demo credentials displayed on the login page were WRONG**.

---

## ✅ **What Was Wrong:**

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```
Login Page showed:  admin@spm.test / admin123   ❌ WRONG!
Actual password:    password123                  ✅ CORRECT
```

The seed file always used `password123`, but the login page was displaying and pre-filling `admin123`.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Login Page Default Password:**
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
const [password, setPassword] = useState('admin123');  ❌

// NEW (CORRECT):
const [password, setPassword] = useState('password123');  ✅
```

### **2. Demo Credentials Display:**
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
Admin:  admin@spm.test / admin123   ❌
Owner:  owner@spm.test / owner123   ❌
Tenant: tenant@spm.test / tenant123 ❌

// NEW (CORRECT):
Admin:  admin@spm.test / password123   ✅
Owner:  owner@spm.test / password123   ✅
Tenant: tenant@spm.test / password123 ✅
```

## 📋 **Correct Login Credentials:**

| Role   | Email               | Password      |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Admin  | `admin@spm.test`    | `password123` |
| Owner  | `owner@spm.test`    | `password123` |
| Tenant | `tenant@spm.test`   | `password123` |

---

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Refresh the page

### **Step 2: Try Login**
1. Email: `admin@spm.test`
2. Password: `password123`
3. Click "Sign In"
4. ✅ Should successfully log in to dashboard

### **Step 3: If Still Failing**

The database might need to be re-seeded. Run this in the browser:

```
Production (Render):
https://promanager-lite-1.onrender.com/api/seed

Local (Docker):
http://localhost:4000/api/seed
```

This will reset the database with fresh users using `password123`.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis:**

The issue was NOT caused by the toast notification deployment. It was a **pre-existing bug** where:

1. The seed file used `password123` for all users
2. The login page incorrectly showed `admin123`, `owner123`, `tenant123`
3. Users were trying the wrong passwords shown on the login page
4. Login failed with "Invalid credentials"

---

## 📊 **User Account Status Check:**

If login still fails after using correct password, the account might be deactivated. Check:

### **Possible Issues:**
1. ❌ Wrong password (`admin123` instead of `password123`)
2. ❌ Account deactivated (`isActive = false`)
3. ❌ Account blocked (`status = 'BLACKLISTED'`)
4. ❌ Database not seeded properly

### **Solution:**
1. Use correct password: `password123`
2. If account is deactivated, reseed database: `/api/seed`
3. If account is blocked, use User Management to unblock

## 🎯 **Quick Fix Summary:**

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Default password field | `admin123` | `password123` |
| Demo credentials shown | `admin123` | `password123` |
| Actual password in DB | `password123` | `password123` |
| Login success | ❌ Failed | ✅ Works |

---

## 🚀 **Deployment:**

Changes committed and pushed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy.

After deployment:
1. Go to login page
2. Use: `admin@spm.test` / `password123`
3. ✅ Login should work!

---

## 📝 **For Future Reference:**

**ALL demo accounts use the same password:**
```
password123
```

**NOT:**
- ❌ `admin123`
- ❌ `owner123`
- ❌ `tenant123`
- ❌ `Welcome@123`
- ❌ Any other variation

**The login issue is now FIXED!** ✅
